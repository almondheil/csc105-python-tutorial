=============================
Resources and Further Reading
=============================

Well, that's everything I had to talk about here! I've decided to dedicate this
last chapter just to a few resources that I find really helpful--some of them
are from within the book and some are further reading, but I wanted to just put
them all in one place.

* `Pandas' documentation <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`_ is a good resource
  if you're stuck with something on Dataframes, or want to find out more about
  how they work.

* `Matplotlib's documentation <https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html>`_ is
  the right place to go if you want to extend your plotting capabilities using
  Matplotlib.

* `Seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_ is another great tool for plotting
  data. It provides a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can generally be
  pretty useful, and it's a good tool if you want to delve more into data
  visualization in Python!

* `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ is another huge data processing library. You'll see it spattered
  across the documentation for the other projects in this list, because it's so
  fantastic at performing operations on whole lists at once and at generating
  fake data to plot.

With that, I'm pretty much finished with this little tutorial! I hope you found
it helpful!

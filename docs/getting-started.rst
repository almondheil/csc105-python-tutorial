Introduction
============

Welcome to my little tutorial on some fun Python stuff! In this webpage-y thing
before you, I'm going to cover how to do a handful of fun and/or interesting
things in Python. Specifically, here are the things I want to cover:

* Reading and writing files using Python's built in tools

* Using pandas_ to make our data processing easier

* Plotting data graphically using matplotlib_ 

I'm doing my best to aim this tutorial so that it will match up with where we
left off with Python and data representation, but in doing that I explain a
handful of things that you already might know for one reason or another.

Definitely feel free to skip sections as needed! I don't want to bore you if
I can avoid it.

Starting a Project
==================

For our purposes here, we're going to use Replit to run our project. It'll
handle dependencies for us, and is generally about a million times easier than
it would be to set up Python on your computer directly. With that said, here's
how to create a new Repl if you haven't done so already!

#. First, go to Replit_ and click the "Create Repl" button.

#. Choose the Python template, and give it whatever sort of title you want. 
   Maybe ``totally-amazing-python-tutorial``?

For now we won't create any files, as I'll have you use a different file for
each upcoming section to keep everything a little organized.

Now, you should be all set up to start reading files in Python! Move onto the
next section to jump into how we can start off with file I/O.

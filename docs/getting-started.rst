Introduction
============

Welcome to my little tutorial on some fun Python stuff! In this booklike thing
before you, I'm going to cover how to do a handful of things that extend the
Python we already learned in class. Here's my big, fancy goal:

When you finish this tutorial, you'll be able to:

* Open a file so Python can read it

* Plot the data in that file

* Process data and output it into a different file

* Save the plot as an image on your computer

To do that, we're going to take advantage of two Python libraries that do a lot
of heavy lifting for us already. The first one is matplotlib_, which we'll use
to graph data, and pandas_, which we'll use to store data in tables as well as
read and write to files. 

They also do a lot more than we need them to, so if you're curious feel free to
read more. Also, keep in mind that these libraries aren't the only way to solve
the problems we're working on here! They are just the ones I chose that happen
to be well-suited for the job.

That may seem intimidating, and admittedly it's going quite a bit past what we
handled in class, but I'll do my best to make sure that this is as smooth a
process as possible.

Starting a Project
==================

First, go to Replit_ and click the "Create Repl" button. Choose the Python
template, and give it whatever sort of title you want.

For now we won't create any files, as I'll have you use a different file for
each upcoming section to keep everything a little organized.

Replit already has all the packages that we need installed, so there shouldn't
be any hassle on that front. If it becomes an issue, I can try to help
troubleshoot! But with any luck, Replit will be much easier to use than anything
we could try to do directly on your computer.

Now, you should be all set up to start reading files in Python!

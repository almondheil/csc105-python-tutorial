Introduction
============

Welcome to my little tutorial on some fun Python stuff! In this booklike thing before you,
I'm going to cover how to do a handful of things that extend the Python we already learned
in class. Here's my big, fancy goal:

We're going to do something called a Fourier Transform, which it a
fascinatingly deep mathematical concept that lets us go from a noisy wave
signal to something where the individual frequencies involved are isolated. For
instance, here's an example!

TODO insert image of messy signal becoming clean. End result

That may seem intimidating, and admittedly it's going quite a bit past what we
handled in class, but I'll do my best to make sure that this is as smooth a
process as possible.

Starting a Project
==================

First, go to Replit_ and click the "Create Repl" button. Choose the Python
template, and give it whatever sort of title you want.

For now we won't create any files, as I'll have you use a different file for
each upcoming section to keep everything a little organized.

Replit already has all the packages that we need installed, so there shouldn't be
any hassle on that front. If it becomes an issue
